Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Jagat. 

"Driven by a passion for solving complex problems through innovative technology, I thrive at the intersection of creativity and code. From designing scalable microservices to enhancing user experiences, Iâ€™m on a mission to deliver impactful software solutions that make a difference."

As a Software Development Engineer with expertise in Java, Spring Boot, and microservices architecture, Iâ€™ve had the privilege of working on high-impact projects that optimize workflows and improve operational efficiency. At Jio Platforms, I spearheaded the development of the Jio Security and Loss Prevention Portal, enabling over 300+ tickets monthly for inventory-related issues and achieving a 40% reduction in incident resolution time. Additionally, I enhanced the Network Operations Center portal by integrating LDAP authentication, boosting team efficiency by 30%.

During my time at CodeQuotient, I honed my full-stack development skills, building a responsive e-commerce application using Node.js, MySQL, and modern web technologies. Solving over 100+ programming challenges solidified my foundation in data structures, algorithms, and problem-solving.

Iâ€™m a GATE 2022 qualifier and have demonstrated technical excellence by completing certifications in React.js, blockchain, and web development. Beyond coding, Iâ€™m passionate about collaborating with cross-functional teams and leveraging Agile methodologies to drive measurable results.

I believe in continuous learning and strive to stay ahead in this ever-evolving field. Whether itâ€™s mastering new tools like AWS Cloud or exploring advanced concepts like Kafka and TDD, I am dedicated to growth and innovation.
